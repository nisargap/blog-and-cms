## About
This is a simple blog and content management system I created in Flask.

## How It Works
A user can register an account that allows them to:
- Make blog posts with an image
- Delete and edit blog posts
- View other users' blogs

## Design Details
For this project I designed the Python 3 library backflask. backflask contains:
- Administrator : a helper class used to handle user administration
- Content : a helper class to manage content
- Database : a helper class to handle all database related operations
- Error : handles errors
- FlaskCreate : handles the creation of a Flask app instance
- Requests : handles all requests
- Security : handles all security including secure hashing (SHA-256) and XSF protection.
- SessionHandler: handles all session related activities
- User : handles all user related activities

The templating engine used is Jinja2. SQLite3 was used for the database management system because of portability and ease of maintenance.

## Things To Do
- Finish Administrator Class
- Frontend Design
